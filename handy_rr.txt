# Installation
sudo apt install linux-tools-common
wget https://github.com/mozilla/rr/releases/download/5.3.0/rr-5.3.0-Linux-$(uname -m).deb
sudo dpkg -i rr-5.3.0-Linux-$(uname -m).deb
echo '-1' | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
echo 'kernel.perf_event_paranoid=-1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
perf record  # And install first package suggested (alike to 'linux-gcp-5.3-tools-5.3.0-1030')
perf record  # Should output something like 'You may not have permission to collect system-wide stats'
sudo apt-get install cpufrequtils
# Following commands may require to be executed after each reboot
sudo systemctl disable ondemand
echo 'GOVERNOR="performance"' | sudo tee /etc/default/cpufrequtils
sudo cpufreq-set -g performance

# This got a bit further on Google cloud, but the error remained the same when using rr: (even though under root 'perf record' did seem to record things - maybe log a rr github issue later on?)
# setcap cap_ipc_lock+eip /usr/bin/perf
# setcap cap_sys_admin+eip /usr/bin/perf
# Error: [FATAL /home/roc/rr/rr/src/PerfCounters.cc:314:start_counter() errno: ENOENT] Unable to open performance counter with 'perf_event_open'; are perf events enabled? Try 'perf record'.
