* reducer.sh, error.log.out (as well as mysql.out and mysqld.out etc.) was changed to log/master.err etc. (and same for all or most .prev files). This needs to be updated for Galera startup, handling etc. ESPECIALLY if the idea is to use new_text_string parsing for Galera runs also (and it is ;)
* pquery-prep-red.sh, search for 'TODO.*cluster' regex. Also fix GR.
