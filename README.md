MariaDB QA
==================================================================================

MariaDB QA is a suite of scripts and utilities that assists in building,
automated testing & bug reporting for MariaDB products.

With thanks and gratitude to the team at Percona for the original work at:
https://github.com/Percona-QA/percona-qa

This repository builds on top of percona-qa, lives as a downstream repository to it, and may at times contribute back to percona-qa.

For a video introduction to some of the scripts, see:

Please Note: 
* For the scripts to run successfully, it is required that sudo is enabled and working and should not request a password.
* Work is ongoing to change various tools to run well with MariaDB products. Please contact Roel if you have questions/for information.
