# Extracts the most relevant string from an error log, in this order:
# filename+line number > assertion message > first mangled c++ frame from error log stack (relatively inaccurate), in two different modes: (_ then (
# In principle, this order is not optimal. When it was instituted, it was not considered that filename+line number would be subject to decay (changing code)
# Yet, because known_bugs.strings exists, and it contains many bugs, it is thought best not to change the order now which would cause a lot of extra work
# now. The best way to workaround this issue is to scan the known_bugs.strings file for "approximately" matching line numbers and then check the corresponding
# bug report for similarity with the bug at hand.

# WARNING! If there are multiple crashes/asserts shown in the error log, remove the older ones (or the ones you do not want)
