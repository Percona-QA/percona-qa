# ------ Compiling / Compiler Issues ------
# If you see for example "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lzlib" in your compilation/build of MySQL, and the build fails because of it, then check:
  ld -lzlib --verbose  # Execute in a user writeable directory. If all entries fail, the lib could not be found. 
  You need to just link one of them to the real zlib on your system  ## With thanks, https://stackoverflow.com/a/21647591/1208218
  sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libz.so.1.2.7 /usr/lib/libzlib.so  ## Though you may have to search for "libz.so" in /usr (cd /usr; find . | grep libz.so)
  This likely works with any linker issue (ld -l{failed lib} --verbose && sudo ln -s ...) 
  Another example;
  ld -ltensorflow --verbose  # Note the "{somelib}.so needed by {somelib}.so" and next line "found {somelib}.so {path}"
  ld /usr/local/lib/libtensorflow.so  # This part; "ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; not setting start address" can be ignored (it is likely just looking for a start address, which will be there in the program which links with this library)
# If you get an error like this;
  /usr/local/lib/somlelib.so: undefined reference to `somefunction@GLIBC_2.23'
  # Then check first what GLIBC version you are running;
  sudo yum list glibc  # Or use ldd --version
  # If the version is older (in this example it was 2.17), then either update the OS or consider adding another glibc along the main OS one;

# ------ Common Issues ------
# Ever seen "-bash: !": event not found" when you were trying to use '!' in for example a sed command? Try for examle: echo "!" | sed 's|!|found|' - the fix;
  histchars=  # in ./bash_profile (or at the command line) will fix it. Reason; https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/History-Interaction.html
  A better fix: use: set +H  # With thanks https://serverfault.com/a/208414
  See also https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html (note: +/-H != +/-h)
# Unlike echo -n, sed cannot parse a live input stream and print the result on a single line step-by-step as the input comes in. Proof;
  for i in `seq 1 10`; do echo $i; sleep 1; done | sed -n "H;/[369]/{x;s/\n/ /g;p}"  # Ref https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html#fn-3
# While the above cannot be done with sed, it can be done quite easily with awk. Semi-similar example, showing output, progressively, on one line;
  for i in `seq 1 10`; do echo $i; sleep 0.3; done | awk '/[369]/{printf "%s",$0}'  # To make example above 100% similar, use: sed -n "/[369]/{s/\n/ /g;p}"
# When calling a function in the background (like the example on the next line) in a script, remember that such a function runs in a subshell
  function &  # By calling a function this way, all variables used within it will be fresh/new and any variables updated will not reflect back in the parent
# When checking for the existence of a directory, do not just use:  if [ -d ${SOME_VAR} ]; then echo "yes"; fi  The reason is that if ${SOME_VAR} is empty,
  the check will still work. Confirm the gotcha by executing:  if [ -d ]; then echo "yes"; fi  Instead, use:  if [ "${SOME_VAR}" != "" -a -d ${SOME_VAR} ];
# Along the same lines of the last issue, it is an easy mistake to make not to include double quotes around variables when checking for (in)equality. Use;
  if [ "${SOME_VAR}" == "Some Text" ]; then ...; fi  instead of not using double quotes (which fails when the variable is empty).
# If you see an error like '/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lsnappy' when compiling, then it means that the snappy (for example) library cannot be found.
  To discover the real source, run  ld -lsnappy --verbose  and look near the end for the locations is scans for 'attempt to open ...' 
  If you have the library in a specific location, you can use;  sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libsnappy.so.1 /usr/lib64/libsnappy.so  or use -L option to your compiler!

# Recursively copying with hidden files included: http://superuser.com/a/804367/457699
  cp -a  # Always use cp -a instead of cp -R (or -r) which does not copy hidden files/directories
# The first echo below will output an asterix, the second will output a directory listing
  echo "$(echo "*")"; echo "----"; echo $(echo "*");
# Except for searching files (if grep -qi "search string" file.txt...), it's best not to use: echo "text" | grep -q "text" to search strings for substrings. It is very slow, and 
  has a gotcha: Test this:  LINE='test'; DONE=0; echo ${LINE} | if grep -q 'test'; then DONE=1; echo "DONE"; fi; echo $DONE  # DONE is 0 because (as per Bash team); 'All elements
  of a pipeline are executed in subshells.  A subshell cannot affect its parent's environment. The 'lastpipe' shell option can change this when job control is not active.'
  Instead, see 'Check a string for presence of a search/substring' above for substring searches. Another gotcha can be seen in this one; echo "abc123xyz457" | grep -o '[^0-9]'
# In Bash, a calling function needs to be declared ABOVE the line it is called from. An example script (place the following 3 lines in a script) will show this (output on right):
  echo "does not work (error will be shown before this line): `works`"         # ./test.sh: line 1: works: command not found
  works(){ echo "works"; }                                                     # does not work (error will be shown before this line): 
  echo "does work (will show 'works' output after semicolon): `works`"         # does work (will show 'works' output after semicolon): works
# However, the following does work, as all the functions are "read" before one of them is called (even though works1 calls a function defined LOWER then the calling line itself):
  works1(){ echo "`works2`"; }
  works2(){ echo "works"; }
  echo "does work: `works1`"                                                   # does work: works
# When wanting to execute multiple commands as one, the syntax is () not $(). For example, to time two commands executed sequentially;
  time $(echo "a";echo "a")  # WRONG: this will try and execute "a" and report: bash: a: command not found... (the total time will still be approx. correct, though bit higher)
  time OUTPUT=$(echo "a" ; echo "a"); echo $OUTPUT  # WRONG: while it works, just like the above, the time is slightly higher (due to the added variable assignment)
  time echo "a";echo "a"     # WRONG: this does not achieve the objective, it only times the first command
  time (echo "a";echo "a")   # CORRECT: this times both commands (without anything affecting time and without any sub-execution or variable assignment)
# Obtain the primary IP address of this machine
  IP_ADDRESS=$(ip route get 8.8.8.8 | head -n1 | cut -d' ' -f8); echo ${IP_ADDRESS}  # Fails on for example Centos 7.4 (needs -f7)
# Better methods to obtain the IP address of this machine
  IP_ADDRESS=$(ip route get 1 | head -n1 awk '{print $NF;exit}'); echo ${IP_ADDRESS}  # Or perhaps even better;
  IP_ADDRESS=$(hostname -I | head -n1 | cut -d' ' -f1); echo ${IP_ADDRESS}  # Current version we use

# When used in a function, the 'declare' command (for example DECLARE -a ARRAY) makes each variable local, as with the 'local' command, unless the '-g' option is used.
  With thanks, https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/136720/bash-array-declared-in-a-function-is-not-available-outside-the-function
  It is thus likely best to use 'local' instead of 'declare' to remove any misunderstanding. This is also the default code syntax for percona-qa scripts
# Gotcha: do not use:  some command | uniq  assuming you will get unique items only. uniq and uniq -u can produce very unexpected results. To see some examples, try these;
  echo -e "1\n2\n2\n3\n2">test;echo "test:";cat test;echo "sort -u test:";sort -u test;echo "uniq test:";uniq test;echo "uniq -u test:";uniq -u test
  echo -e "1\n2\n2\n3">test;echo "test:";cat test;echo "uniq -u test:";uniq -u test
  With uniq -u it keeps any line which is truly unique, and this is why the first uniq, the first uniq -u and the second uniq -u results all so different
  Thus; uniq is a versatile tool, but only if you are after very specific functionality. If not, always use short -u
# Sort unique vs uniq: sort -u sorts the input list and only leaves unique entries. uniq on the other hand does not sort and removes only adjoining same entries
  cat need_sorted_file_with_unique_results_only.txt | sort -u; cat need_adjoining_same_entries_removed; | uniq; # cat need_all_duplicates_removed.txt | uniq -u
# Gotcha: This will not work: $ if [[ "a-b" == *"a[-_]b"* ]]; then echo "yes"; fi
          This will     work: $ if [[ "a-b" == *"a"[-_]"b"* ]]; then echo "yes"; fi  # With thanks, http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pattern
# Gotcha: sh -x != bash -x. If you use sh -x instead of bash -x to see the debug output of a complex script, you may see errors like this:
