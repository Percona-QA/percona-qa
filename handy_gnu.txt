# ------ Common Issues ------
# Ever seen "-bash: !": event not found" when you were trying to use '!' in for example a sed command? Try for examle: echo "!" | sed 's|!|found|' - the fix;
  histchars=  # in ./bash_profile (or at the command line) will fix it. Reason; https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/History-Interaction.html
# Unlike echo -n, sed cannot parse a live input stream and print the result on a single line step-by-step as the input comes in. Proof;
  for i in `seq 1 10`; do echo $i; sleep 1; done | sed -n "H;/[369]/{x;s/\n/ /g;p}"  # Ref https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html#fn-3
# While the above cannot be done with sed, it can be done quite easily with awk. Semi-similar example, showing output, progressively, on one line;
  for i in `seq 1 10`; do echo $i; sleep 0.3; done | awk '/[369]/{printf "%s",$0}'  # To make example above 100% similar, use: sed -n "/[369]/{s/\n/ /g;p}"
# When calling a function in the background (like the example on the next line) in a script, remember that such a function runs in a subshell
  function &  # By calling a function this way, all variables used within it will be fresh/new and any variables updated will not reflect back in the parent
# When checking for the existence of a directory, do not just use:  if [ -d ${SOME_VAR} ]; then echo "yes"; fi  The reason is that if ${SOME_VAR} is empty,
  the check will still work. Confirm the gotcha by executing:  if [ -d ]; then echo "yes"; fi  Instead, use:  if [ "${SOME_VAR}" != "" -a -d ${SOME_VAR} ];
# Along the same lines of the last issue, it is an easy mistake to make not to include double quotes around variables when checking for (in)equality. Use;
  if [ "${SOME_VAR}" == "Some Text" ]; then ...; fi  instead of not using double quotes (which fails when the variable is empty).
# If you see an error like '/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lsnappy' when compiling, then it means that the snappy (for example) library cannot be found.
  To discover the real source, run  ld -lsnappy --verbose  and look near the end for the locations is scans for 'attempt to open ...' 
  If you have the library in a specific location, you can use;  sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libsnappy.so.1 /usr/lib64/libsnappy.so  or use -L option to your compiler!

# The first echo below will output an asterix, the second will output a directory listing
  echo "$(echo "*")"; echo "----"; echo $(echo "*");
# Except for searching files (if grep -qi "search string" file.txt...), it's best not to use: echo "text" | grep -q "text" to search strings for substrings. It is very slow, and 
  has a gotcha: Test this:  LINE='test'; DONE=0; echo ${LINE} | if grep -q 'test'; then DONE=1; echo "DONE"; fi; echo $DONE  # DONE is 0 because (as per Bash team); 'All elements
  of a pipeline are executed in subshells.  A subshell cannot affect its parent's environment. The 'lastpipe' shell option can change this when job control is not active.'
  Instead, see 'Check a string for presence of a search/substring' above for substring searches. Another gotcha can be seen in this one; echo "abc123xyz457" | grep -o '[^0-9]'
# In Bash, a calling function needs to be declared ABOVE the line it is called from. An example script (place the following 3 lines in a script) will show this (output on right):
  echo "does not work (error will be shown before this line): `works`"         # ./test.sh: line 1: works: command not found

  echo "does work (will show 'works' output after semicolon): `works`"         # does work (will show 'works' output after semicolon): works
# However, the following does work, as all the functions are "read" before one of them is called (even though works1 calls a function defined LOWER then the calling line itself):
  works1(){ echo "`works2`"; }
  works2(){ echo "works"; }
  echo "does work: `works1`"                                                   # does work: works
# When wanting to execute multiple commands as one, the syntax is () not $(). For example, to time two commands executed sequentially;

  time OUTPUT=$(echo "a" ; echo "a"); echo $OUTPUT  # WRONG: while it works, just like the above, the time is slightly higher (due to the added variable assignment)
  time echo "a";echo "a"     # WRONG: this does not achieve the objective, it only times the first command
  time (echo "a";echo "a")   # CORRECT: this times both commands (without anything affecting time and without any sub-execution or variable assignment)
