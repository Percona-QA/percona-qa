Almost all issues (85%-95%) reproduce when using;
pquery-run.sh > ~/percona-qa/pquery-prep-red.sh > ~/percona-qa/pquery-clean-known.sh > ~/percona-qa/pquery-results.sh > individual reducers

However, for issues that fail to reproduce, try these things (in this order):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* If the issue reproduced before and now no longer does, check the <filename>_out.prev file line count (wc -l <trial_nr>/<filename>_out.prev) vs
  the linecount in the current file (wc -l <trial_nr>/<filename>_out). If the line number in the <filename>_out.prev file is bigger, copy that 
  one over the current file and restart reducer without changes. Things like out-of-disk-space (even in /tmp) may cause the this type of issue

* If the issue reproduces in 'Verify stage' in reducer, set FORCE_SPORADIC=1 in settings to reducer faster/more easily (uses 10 threads for stage 1).
  End somewhere during stage 1 when you have 5-10 lines left and reduction does not seem to progress much anymore. Edit manually further if needed.

* Reducer, when using the mysql client for replay may not be replaying the full SQL log. To check this, check the reducer client output log for errors like: 
  "No connection. Trying to reconnect... ERROR 2005 (HY000): Unknown MySQL server host '{some random string}' (0)" if you are using the mysql client for replay.
  Then search the SQL input for {some random string}. Likely some sort of parsing error pointed the client at another server. When the mysql client is used for 
  replay (as opposed to pquery which (no matter if it is using random or sequential replay) re-connects to the server for each query), the connection with the
  server is made only once (i.e. no reconnection happen). Thus, if something disconnects the client from the server, further SQL replay will fail this error.

* Check the reducer client output log (note 'client' here can be mysql client or pquery) for other clear errors/issues, especially towards the end of the log.

* If you have replay uses CLI vs MTR vs pquery note that MTR by default sets --default-storage-engine=MyISAM, which may lead to significant replay differences

* Note that QUERYTIMEOUT may potentially affect overall issue reproducibility for issues where queries get terminated by the timeout (90 seconds by default)

* Change the TEXT="..." to a much more simplified form. Regex capable. You can also use another string then the one suggested (like a stack excerpt) An example:
  Change "scale >= 0 .... precision > 0 .... scale <= precision" to "scale.*precision". If it works, verify correct functioning of percona-qa/text_string.sh

* Check the error log and search for the assertion, or first few crashing frames as shown by gdb. The issue may have already been logged. 
  Add it to percona-qa/known_bugs.strings[.notestcase] if you find it please.

* Check the client output of the original pquery trial (/<trial>/*thread-x.sql) against the output of reducer's subreducer's directory /subreducer/nr/<TBD>

* Set FORCE_SKIPV=1 in reducer, which auto-enables FORCE_SPORADIC=1 and skips verify, so immediately goes into MULTI stage 1 (and one can let it sit there 
  churning away for an hour to see if the issue reproduces at all). This is ideal for highly sporadic issues, where verify stage failed to reproduce the issue.

* If the last step fails, do this; still have FORCE_SPORADIC=1 and FORCE_SKIPV=1, but search in reducer for MULTI_THREADS=10 and change it to =25 or even =40.
  This forces reducer to immediately start with this many threads. Carefull - with =40 you can easily overload even a high performance server or run out of
  space on /dev/shm easily. Ensure plenty is available (4GB+ minimum, more preferred - as a guide, my tmps is permanently set at 12GB with 16GB physical memory)

* Another method which works well is where reducer has reduced the testcase to let's say ~500 lines, but now stagnates. So, you stop reducer and set
  FORCE_SPORADIC=1, but now the issue no longer reproduces (due to very low reproducibility or any other cause). Cat ($ cat) the original testcase into a new
  file (cat testcase > newfile) and cat the original testcase into that new file once more (cat testcase >> newfile). Reduce this new testcase (now about
  1000 lines) using FORCE_SPORADIC. This item is usefull where an issue reproduced well, then stopped reproducing around 200-1000 lines.

* The previous method may also work in general. For example, an issue does not reproduce. Cat it twice into a new file and set FORCE_SKIPV=1. Set reducer.sh
  to use the resulting (doubled up) file as the new testcase & restart reducer. Example: one issue failed to reproduce, but using 3x original testcase cat into
  one file worked. The testcase was still reduced to normal size.

* If you ever run into a situation where reducer happily reduces from many (10-30k) lines to ~30 lines and then gets completely stuck, just re-start the
  reduction altogether. The random chunk selection may make the issue more/less reproducible/pronounced. Note; this happens only infrequently (that it 
  gets stuck in such a solid way) - usually with a few tweaks further reduction is possible.

* Is the issue a failing shutdown, server hang, or runaway query? Use the new MODE=0 in reducer.sh if the issue does not produce any specific output. If the
  issue does produce specific output, and there is still a time-delay of any sort which highlights the issue, use TIMEOUT_COMMAND instead (with any mode)

* For older pquery-run.sh runs, delete all generated reducer*.sh files, and re-run pquery-prep-red.sh as this will use the (regularly & recently updated) new
  reducer.sh code which is better. Note that if any of the above mentioned features/solutions were not (and thus now are) available, you can apply them now

* Set PQUERY_MOD=0 instead of PQUERY_MOD=1. This forces CLI replay instead of pquery replay and this may, for some issues, improve reproducibility again.

* Along the lines of the PQUERY_MOD=0 method, after having reduced any issue for some time using the PQUERY_MOD=1 option (which is btw automatically set by 
  pquery-prep-red.sh), and if the issue no longer reproduces well or simplification stagnates, then set PQUERY_MOD=0 to enable mysql CLI (instead of pquery 
  binary) replay. This may work to reproduce and/or simplify further, and even more so in combination with the "double cat testcase" solution mentioned above 
  (i.e. first double up the testcase first).

* With PQUERY_MOD=1, change the pquery binary from pquery to pquery-ms. (The idea here is similar as changing PQUERY_MOD=1 to PQUERY_MOD=0 - we are using 
  another binary, slightly different (in this case a different compilation of pquery) to trigger the issue.) This has helped in one difficult case so far

* Interleave your SQL file with SELECT SLEEP(1); after every command. It will cause slow replay, but a timeout triggered in the original run may be re-
  triggered correctly this way. Put SELECT SLEEP(1); (with cr/lf at end) in a file B.txt, then sed "0~75 r B.txt" A.txt > C.txt; A=original & C=outcome SQL

* If you get really stuck on a bug, analyze the stack traces and core file. What is happening at the time of the crash? If CREATE TABLE statements were
  running, select a number of them from the SQL trace (the relevant ones according to their SQL) and put them in a seperate file. Make the SQL much more 
  uniform for this handfull of statements (20-30), for example, all table names become t1, all tablespace names become ts1. Insert for example a few 
  DROP TABLE and DROP TABLESPACE statements so that there is some re-iteration possible (relevant in this case, may not be in yours). Etc. Then re-run
  the original run with the new SQL file to see if this new (much smaller) SQL input file still generates the same bug. If so, at the very least you now
  have a ~50 lines testcase. You can reduce it further by hand (if the issue is still not reproducible otherwise). You can also increase threads to trigger
  the issue more easily (recommended for hard to trigger issues).

* Test the current partly-simplified SQL testcase against mysqld (easy way is just to SOURCE the test case file from the CLI, or use the generated {epoch} 
  scripts). If it crashes with the same crash, you can set PQUERY_MOD=0, FORCE_SPORADIC=0, FORCE_SKIPV=1 etc. Another strategy here is to replay the testcase 
  against upstream when you were testing PS. Does it crash there too? If so, you can try changing MYBASE to see if the issue replays/reduces better on upstream.

* Note that some testcases require SOURCEing them at the mysql> CLI command prompt. If reducer.sh reduced all the way down to a few lines, but the resulting
  testcase does not reproduce the bug when the SQL is copied/pasted into the CLI, try to use SOURCE {epoch}.sql instead. Also try the run scripts as produced
  by reducer.sh; basic steps: {epoch}_init, {epoch}_start, {epoch}_run and/or {epoch}_run_pquery. See reducer_workdir/{epoch}_how_to_use.txt for full info.

* Review the code where the bug happened, and add in SQL specificially related to the area. For example, in one case there was the following text surrounding
  a debug assertion: /* If the transaction is DD attachable trx, it should be AC-NL-RO-RC (AutoCommit-NonLocking-ReadOnly-ReadCommited) trx */
  So, adding in lots (20+ queries) of SET ... TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL ..., START TRANSACTION ..., COMMIT, and autocommit on/off SQL (sourced from main.sql) 
  into the sql file ({epoch}.sql as generated by reducer.sh) and also changing the pquery replay file generated ({epoch}_run_pquery) by removing "--no-shuffle",
  increasing the --threads to =150 and finally adding/setting --queries=999999 options, the issue now replayed quite ok - still with a short testcase overall.

* Go back to an older version of the file. i.e. instead of _out_out, start with _out or even the original testcase again. The randomness in simplification
  chunk deletion may take a very different route this time. This has shown to work well

* Try with and without jemalloc. In one instance, this made the difference between reproducibility or not. The other thing to check is that all more generic
  mysqld options (--no-defaults, --sql_mode=ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY, --event-scheduler=ON etc.) also match between tests.

* If all else fails, set MODE=4 instead of MODE=3. This will now look for any crash. 
  Note that as reducer is randomly chunking, you may run into different crashes and as such have to restart reducer a few times to reduce to the correct one.

* Open the sql file in vi and execute   :%s/^#.*\n//g   in vi. This will drop all comment lines. 
  This will only help for CLI-replayed issue (i.e. when not using pquery mode in reducer, which is default for all pquery runs handled by percona-qa scripts)

Summary: if you dilegently tried all of the above, reproducibility for all issues is near 100%.
