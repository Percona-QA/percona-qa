* Approximate issue description;

  When using --log-bin as an option to MTR, one cannot change the binlog format from the default STATEMENT to ROW or MIXED

  For example when using;

  --mysqld=--binlog-format=ROW  --mysqld=--server-id=102  --mysqld=--log-bin  --mysqld=--relay-log

  options to MTR, the used/reported binlog-format will still be STATEMENT

* This is because of the following hardcoded code in mysql-test-run.pl;

    elsif ($skip_binlog and mtr_match_prefix($arg, "--binlog-format"))
    {
      ; # Dont add --binlog-format when running without binlog
    }

  This looks somewhat incorrect because somehow skip_binlog is always activated automatically.

  It is not clear how exactly, but maybe, it is taking from some default file, like;

  $ cat t/skip_log_bin-master.opt
    --loose-skip-log-bin

  or

   lib/mtr_cases.pm:    push(@{$tinfo->{'master_opt'}}, "--loose-skip-log-bin");
   lib/mtr_cases.pm:    push(@{$tinfo->{'slave_opt'}}, "--loose-skip-log-bin");

* If you want to use --binlog-format, comment out the lines around line number 5223 (i.e. all elsif code shown above)

* This leads also to another question; how come the replication suite can use ROW/MIXED etc.

  It may be that the replication suite is able to still use ROW and MIXED via this file;

  mysql-test $ cat suite/rpl/combinations
  [row]
  binlog-format=row

  [stmt]
  binlog-format=statement

  [mix]
  binlog-format=mixed
